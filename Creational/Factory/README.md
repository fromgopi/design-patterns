# FACTORY METHOD
 
### GENERAL


**Creational** GoF design pattern that defines an interface for creating objects, but lets individual subclasses
decide which concrete object to instantiate.

#### USAGE

It's mainly used when there is an uncertainty in future development, and you don't know beforehand what concrete
objects have to be accommodated in the rest of the code.
